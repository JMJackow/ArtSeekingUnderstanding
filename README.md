# READ ME
Hello everyone! Welcome to the repository for sharing resources among Templeton Religion Trust (TRT) grantees and other scholars. This repository is created as a part of the Art Seeking Understanding initiative ([see website here](https://templetonreligiontrust.org/areas-of-focus/art-seeking-understanding/)) and as a result of scholarly interest by other TRT Grantees during the Grantee Workshop at the University of Notre Dame (05/26-05/28).

We hope to have a collaborative page where scholars from different fields can come by and utilize. To do so, there are ***a few guidelines*** we wish to note:
1) [Publicly available datasets](https://github.com/ulusoyez/TRT/blob/main/Datasets/Publicly%20Accessible%20Links/ReadMe.md)
   -  If you are adding a dataset, please make sure to include necessary citations (if there is any) and some explanations around it. 
      -  Currently (06/02), we have music and movies as main dataset groups. However, feel free to add images or news if you have any publicly available dataset on those.
2) [Scales](https://github.com/ulusoyez/TRT/tree/main/Scales)
   -  We tried to create multiple groups for scales. Please see [the summary of scales](https://github.com/ulusoyez/TRT/blob/main/Scales/ReadMe.md) for available scales. 
      - If you wish to add a new scale, make sure to include APA 7 citation for the scale and all items of the scale (as well as add the scale info to the [the summary of scales](https://github.com/ulusoyez/TRT/blob/main/Scales/ReadMe.md).
      - If you are not familiar with APA 7, you can use this website: [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html).
 





If you are a grantee (or a research assistant in a related project) and wish to be included as a collaborator, please email your information (e.g., name, project name (and team)) to ulusoyez@msu.edu
   - In the meantime, you can visit [this website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to learn about how to format in github md files.
