I tend to understand the reasons why character X does what he or she does. <br />
While viewing the show I could feel the emotions character X portrayed. <br />
During viewing, I felt I could really get inside character Xâ€™s head. <br />
At key moments in the show, I felt I knew exactly what character X was going through. <br />
While viewing the program, I wanted character X to succeed in achieving his or her goals. <br />
When character X succeeded I felt joy, but when he or she failed, I was sad. <br />
