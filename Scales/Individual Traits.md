# Need for Affect
## Appel et ala., 2012

Approach:
I feel that I need to experience strong emotions regularly.
Emotions help people to get along in life.
I think that it is important to explore my feelings.
It is important for me to be in touch with my feelings.
It is important for me to know how others are feeling.
Avoidance:
If I reflect on my past, I see that I tend to be afraid of feeling emotions.
I find strong emotions overwhelming and therefore try to avoid them.
I would prefer not to experience either the lows or highs of emotion.
I do not know how to handle my emotions, so I avoid them.
Emotions are dangerousâ€”they tend to get me into situations that I would rather avoid.
