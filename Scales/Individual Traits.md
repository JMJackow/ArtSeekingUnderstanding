## Appel et ala., 2012 <br />
<br />

**10-item Need for Affect Questionnaire-Short Form (NAQ-S)** <br />
### Approach <br />
I feel that I need to experience strong emotions regularly. <br />
Emotions help people to get along in life. <br />
I think that it is important to explore my feelings. <br />
It is important for me to be in touch with my feelings. <br />
It is important for me to know how others are feeling. <br />
### Avoidance <br />
If I reflect on my past, I see that I tend to be afraid of feeling emotions. <br />
I find strong emotions overwhelming and therefore try to avoid them. <br />
I would prefer not to experience either the lows or highs of emotion. <br />
I do not know how to handle my emotions, so I avoid them. <br />
Emotions are dangerous—they tend to get me into situations that I would rather avoid. <br />
